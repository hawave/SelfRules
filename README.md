# SelfRules

Rules for Clash. Like [CFW](https://archive.org/details/clash_for_windows_pkg) / [CFA](https://github.com/cfwtf/clash_for_android) / [OpenClash](https://github.com/vernesong/OpenClash) etc. Also some rules for [Shadowrocket](https://apps.apple.com/app/shadowrocket/id932747118) & [Quantumult X](https://apps.apple.com/app/quantumult-x/id1443988620).

All files Read-Only.

‚ùó FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. You can NOT share without my permission. ‚ùó

üëâ Keep the URL I gave you, paste and click Download/Update.

Some files are rewritten from the rules format of the [Subscription Converter](https://sublink.dev) site. Added some self-use rules.

Any questions can ask me reasonably.
